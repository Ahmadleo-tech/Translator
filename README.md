## Multi-Language Text Translator with Speech Output

This Python script provides a simple way to translate text into various languages and convert the translated text into speech. The script uses the Google Translate API via the `googletrans` library for translation and the `pyttsx3` library for text-to-speech functionality.

### Features
- **Text Translation:** Translate input text into any language supported by Google Translate.
- **Speech Output:** Convert the translated text to speech and play it back to the user.
- **Language Support:** Comprehensive language support with mappings for multiple languages, including their native scripts.

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/translator-speech.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install googletrans pyttsx3
   ```

### Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python translator_speech.py
   ```
2. Enter the text you want to translate when prompted.
3. Enter the target language name or code (e.g., 'Spanish' or 'es').

### Example
```plaintext
Enter Text (Any Language) You Want to Translate: Hello, how are you?
Enter language name or code: French
```
This will translate "Hello, how are you?" into French and then read the translated text aloud.
